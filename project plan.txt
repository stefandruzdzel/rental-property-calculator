Project Summary:
An online rental property calculator, for a simple purchase with a loan.
It will improve on the free calculators out there by:
    a) Automatically pulling in data, where possible
    b) Simulating volatility: IE: Other calculators may assume maintenance is $200/mo, while in reality sometimes it's $0, othertimes it's $3000.



To Do:

x1. Copy in Flask and HTML templates from CS50 assignment, as a starting point
x2. Make sure Flask and other required libraries work in my coding environment
3. Read up on what should be contained in my Read ME file
I'll do this properly once I figure out how to use git
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes
x4. Look at other calculators for inspiration, save URL's to give them credit as inspiration
x5. Plan out a version of the form 
x6. Plan the outputs I'll want, graphs charts etc
x7. Decide on the technology I'll need to create the outputs
    a) Output a table
    b) https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/05/static-interactive-widgets/
x8. Decide on the distributions I'll use for simulation: IE: Maintenance avg is $200/mo, find a right skewed distribution that fits that
9. Create that form in HTML
10. Run necessary Python calculations for basic numeric outputs
11. Create the fancy graph / chart outputs
12. Webscrape property information based on an address
13. Scrape Rent Zestimate
14. Scrape Airbnb estimate from Rabbu or Airdna
15. Save proforma some how, export to pdf, or use a login, or ?=
16. Improve assumptions by pulling in historical trends (appreciation, rent growth)
